After installing librosa, when you run it you will get sometype of numba.core.decorators error.
when you have that error type "pip3 freeze" and it would give you the list of all libraris installed. search for numba and check out it's version
the version will be someother. try uninstalling it and install number version 0.48.0 by doing "pip3 install numba==0.48.0"

The above mentioned libraries are somewhat unique, the remaining libraries are standard libraries that you can install easily.
for speechrecognition, kindly read it's documentation that is available on the link.

NOTE : When you set these up, kindly arrage a session for me with the testers so, i can guide them for best accuracu.
Thanks.
